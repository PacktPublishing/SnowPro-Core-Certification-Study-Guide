-- You can create a CSV file format object with a comma as the field delimiter and skip the header:
CREATE FILE FORMAT csv_file_format
TYPE = CSV
FIELD_DELIMITER =','
SKIP_HEADER = 1;

-- You can specify the file format directly in the COPY INTO command and can also specify the file format object with the stage using the following commands:
CREATE STAGE <stagename>
FILE_FORMAT = (FORMAT_NAME = <fileformatname >);

-- You can specify the file format with the COPY command with different methods, as shown in the following code extract:
COPY INTO table_name
FROM @stagename
FILE_FORMAT = (FORMAT_NAME = <fileformatname >);

COPY INTO sales_data_table
FROM @my_stage/sales_data.csv
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_DELIMITER = ',');

COPY INTO product_data_table
FROM @product_stage/products.json
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'JSON');
